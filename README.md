# Check Mates LoL
**Release coming soon**

A GUI application to check stats of teammates when arriving on a lobby.

## Installation

Install dependencies (virtual env is recommended)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create storage file from example
```bash
cp storage.example.json storage.json
```

## Usage

You can launch the app with python
```bash
python main.py
```

Or you can create an executable file
```bash
pyinstaller "Check Mates Lol.spec"
```

Then, you can take the folder `Check Mates LoL` inside `dist` and put it wherever 
you like.<br>
Inside this folder, you'll find an executable file called `Check Mates LoL`, which is
the program. You can now create a shortcut from this file and place it in your Desktop 
to use it like a normal program.
